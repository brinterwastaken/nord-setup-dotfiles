# Firefox theme

Preview-



- I used https://github.com/rafamadriz/Firefox-Elegant-NordTheme css theme, and nighttab for the startpage.

- Nighttab- https://github.com/zombieFox/nightTab

- Nighttab config file can be found in this directory, once the extension is installed click the settings icon, click Data, then Import Data. Browse for the .json file and it will apply my configuration.

- Make sure to change your name in nighttab settings > Header > Greeting.
